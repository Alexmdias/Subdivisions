# Subdivison algorithms


### Usage
Open the source folder as a project in an IDE. (preferably visual studio) Then debug main.cpp.
At execution, there will be a console with very simple instructions on how to operate the program.

If any technical problems are encountered, I included an executable program in
source\out\executable\X64 which only requires a windows machine and a double mouse click to operate.
